# Hidden-Markov-Models

## Overview
Hidden Markov Models are used extensively in Artificial Intelligence, Pattern Recognition, Computer Vision, and many other fields.  If a system has unobservable (hidden) states and each state is independent of the prior, then we can create a model of that system using probability distributions over a sequence of observations.  The idea is that we can provide this system with a series of observations to use to query what is the most likely sequence of states that generated these observations.
